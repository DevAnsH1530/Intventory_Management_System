# Inventory Management System (Java SE 8) - h1
## Project Description - h2
The Inventory Management System is a Java SE 8 based application designed to help
businesses efficiently manage their inventory. This system utilizes Java's Collections framework,
multithreading, and robust exception handling for improved performance and reliability.
### Key Features - h3
1. **Product Management:** Add, edit, and delete products in the inventory. Each product
includes details such as ID, name, price, and quantity on hand.
2. **Inventory Tracking:** Maintain real-time inventory status to check stock levels for products.
3. **Multithreading:** Utilizes multithreading for concurrent access to the inventory to improve
system responsiveness.
4. **Exception Handling:** Robust error handling and graceful error reporting to ensure the
application runs smoothly.
5. **User-friendly Interface:** Command-line interface with easy-to-use commands for product
and inventory management.
### Technologies Used - h3
- **Java Version:** Java SE 8
- **Collections Framework:** Utilized for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Multithreading:** Java's `ExecutorService` for handling concurrent access to the inventory.
- **Exception Handling:** Java's exception handling mechanisms for error handling.
